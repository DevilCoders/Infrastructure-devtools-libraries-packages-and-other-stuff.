# Advanced Feature Catalog

Infra Manager Studio now includes a curated collection of more than thirty
advanced capabilities. These are represented via the `AdvancedFeature`
dataclass and surfaced in the **Advanced** tab.

## Feature Categories

The catalog spans the following key areas:

- **Concurrency** – async orchestrators and multithreaded pipeline fan-out.
- **Bulk Operations** – repository syncs, batch secret rotation, and drift
  detection at scale.
- **Scheduling** – fleet cron management and patch wave coordination.
- **Security & Governance** – compliance auditing, access drift monitoring, and
  supply chain protections such as artifact signing.
- **Reliability** – canary analysis, SLO scoreboards, and error budget
  forecasting.
- **Automation & GitOps** – template libraries, GitOps sync controllers, and
  ChatOps responders.
- **FinOps & Multi-Cloud** – cost anomaly detection and multi-cloud
  orchestration.
- **AI Enablement** – AI runbook partners, model observatories, and workflow
  forges that empower custom assistants.

Each entry is intentionally concise so you can align it with your existing
systems or roadmap documentation. Extend the list by appending additional
`AdvancedFeature` records in `ApplicationState.load()`.
